# Welcome Welcome

Hi there!

This github page hosts a number of the projects I've done through my Data Science course at General Assembly. I'll be adding content from side projects as time moves forward.

Some of my interests include music and the arts, food, travel, beer, politics, puns, urban studies, and the environment (not necessarily in that order). I'm always looking to collaborate or discuss any of these topics with folks, so please reach out!
